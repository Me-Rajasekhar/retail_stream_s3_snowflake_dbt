"""Placeholder for Snowpipe REST trigger.

This repo encourages using Snowpipe auto-ingest via S3 notifications (recommended).
If you need to call Snowpipe REST API, follow Snowflake docs to create a JWT and call the REST endpoint.
This script intentionally does not implement JWT signing here â€” use snowflake-connector-python or Snowflake's examples.
